# Chirath's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!

This project was built from scratch leveraging AI (DeepMind tools and Claude Code) to experiment with rapid prototyping, modern frontend design aesthetics (Next.js, Tailwind, Canvas animations), and completely data-driven architectures.

## Live Site

The site is deployed and available at: [https://chirathr.com/](https://chirathr.com/)

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
(Locally, the site will run on `http://localhost:3000`)

## Configuration & Content

All portfolio content is perfectly isolated from the UI code. To update my information, I just edit:
`src/data/portfolio.ts`

## Deployment

The project is configured for a static export and deploys directly to GitHub Pages via the included GitHub Action.
